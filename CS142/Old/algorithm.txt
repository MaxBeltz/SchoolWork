The Goal is to create a calculator that can add subtract multiply and divide
	Also provide a menue to select the operation that the user wishes to use
	
input
	2 ints + a string for which operation is being used
output
	1 int
	
First we must declair two variables num1 and num2 as null
	both of these will be set to an input (num1 to the first and num2 to the second)
we must also make a string, operation, used as menue.
	
The entire code will be put on a while loop to allow the calculator to keep being used.
Next we must set up three sets of inputs
	The first input will be a string to determine what operation will be used
		(addition subtraction multiplication division or end)
	The next two inputs will link to the variables num1 and num2 respectivly

Various if else if	statements will be used to link the user's choice (operation) to the correct operation.
	
The output will use the variables num1 and num2 to complete whatever operation was selected
	(num1+num2 num1-num2 num1*num2 num1/num2)
	the program will then loop again to the top so the user can either preform another operation or end

For the division operation we must make a double variable and convert num1 and num 2 to doubles for acuracy

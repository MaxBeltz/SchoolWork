Problem
	create a simulation of a game between Butler and an opponent while displaying the real time scores and the winner
	
Input 
	one string to determine the opposing team 
	
Output
	A string plus the two scores to show the current scores
	The final scores plus who won and by how much
		once end is triggered

Step by step:
	1. Create 2 variables (ints) to represent the scores of the two teams
	2. Create a string to represent the name of the opposing team
	3. Create 3 int variables to use with a random number generator in the future
		used to determine if there was a score by who and how much
	4. Create 2 int variables to represent the game clock
		time and quarter
	5. Set the initial scores to 0 and quarter to 1
	6. Seed a random number generator with the systen time for later use
	7. Ask the user for the name of the opposing team
		using prompting outputs
	8. Create 2 series of loops one inside the other
		the outside loop will run every quarter the inside every second
	9. For the inside loop
		A. Set the game clock to 720 (12 minutes)
		B. For each second
			run an rng and chenk against a specific number to score
				if a score run an rng for which team scored and by how much
				make sure to break up output with a dummy input
			wether a score or not subtract a second from the clock
		C. Once out of time increase the quarter by 1 (until 4) and repeat per the outside loop
	10. The outside loop should repeat 4 times for the 4 quarters
	11. Once the loops have stopped you have the final scores
	12. Have a set of 3 if statements to determine the outcome and print an appropriate statement

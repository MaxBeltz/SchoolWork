Problem
	create a simulation given the scores of Butler and Xavier to determine who would win at a given point.

Input 
	two ints representing the scores of the two teams
	
Output
	a string stating that butler is winning by how much or that butler is loosing and how much they need to win

Step by step:
	1. Create 2 variables (ints) to represent the scores of the two teams
	2. Set up a series of inputs (2) to represent the scores of the two teams
		the first input for butler the second for Xavier
	3. Create an if else statement to determine which value is greater (assuming no equality)
		If Butler is greater than Xavier
			Display winning Butler message plus difference in score
				Butler-Xavier
		else (impling Butler is less than Xavier)
			Display loosing Butler message and required score for winning
				Xavier-Butler + 1
	4. End the code

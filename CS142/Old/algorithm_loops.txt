Problem: We need to create a manue that allows the user to "order" from it and allows them to pay
		 An amout of "money" once the program is ended

Input: A series of inputs to represent the menue items the the user wishes to order.
	   A double to represent how much money they are using to pay with 

Output: A chunk of text to signify a menue with prices and order numbers to correspond to each item
        A sentence to confirm what was ordered
		A total cost once the order has ended
		A statement of change due given the price and payment
		
Step by step
	Start by creating a series of variables to represent certain values
		create a series of doubles to represent the price of each menue item 
		create a double to store then display the total cost 
		create an int to represent the order number
	Set up a while loop to run for the entirety of the order.
		Within this loop 
			print the menue
			ask for an input to represent the order number 
			Add the price of each item to the total cost
			Continue until the user triggers the end of the program
	Once the "order is complete"
		Give the total price of the order
		Ask the user to input the amount they are paying with.
			confirm that they are paying the right amount.
		Thank them and give them their "change"

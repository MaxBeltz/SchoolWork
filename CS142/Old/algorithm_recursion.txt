1. Create a char array that will be used for the reversing
2. Set that equal to an input from the user
	A. Create the input near the end, start off with a defined word for testing
3. Find the length of the array
4. Pass the array and its length into reverseword
	A. Create an if else statement
		a. Within this if then create two variables to be defined each run
			1. A dump char variable to not loose any data upon the swapping
			2. An int that will represent the actual length of the array
		b. Have dump get the char in the position of the passed number - 1
		c. Have the position of the passed number - 1 get the positon of (actual length - passed length)
		d. Have the positon (actual lenght - passed number)
		e. Subtract one from the passed number
		f. Call the function again with the modified passed number and matrix
	B. The else will be triggered when the actual length - the passed number > the passed number
		a. At this point print out the array char by char.

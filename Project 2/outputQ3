We hope you enjoyed the intermission, Now back to the show

We begin Part 3 with the same character array that we know and love, a, b, c, and of course the char the myth the legend...d
We are goint to reprint the array as bits to remind you, the viewer, what to look for
01100001
01100010
01100011
01100100

Beautiful, now on to the tests, we will be counting the number of 1s in a given range as well as the 4th 1 in a range

num 1s from 7 - 27 = 8
The 4th 1 from 7 - 27 is position: 16
Wow, that was pretty dang slow, what the hecky. Lets see if we cen do it quicker using everyone's favorite method
Say it with me know:
You: a lookup table
I cant hear you
You: A LOOKUP TABLE
That's the spirit, lets see how that works...
num 1s from 0 - 27 using a lookup table = 11
The 4th 1 using a lookup table is in position 4

Wow, that sure was fun, thank you so much for stopping by
Make sure to watch out for the ghost shark on the way out and be sure to give Max and Ian an A!
Bye Bye now!
